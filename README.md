## Gadget Sales Analysis â€“ Advertising Impact
---

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores how advertising expenditure per person influences gadget sales across cities.
Using R we cleaned a raw dataset of 1 000 + records, engineered new variables, removed outliers, transformed skewed data, and built a simple linear regression model to quantify the relationship between advertising spend and sales percentage.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset

Original file: gadget_0.csv (â‰ˆ 1 000 rows Ã— 4 columns: name, population, advertising, sales)

Added a row ID column for easier tracking.

Variables include population counts, advertising spend ($) and gadget sales numbers.

ðŸ›  Tools & Packages

Language: R

Libraries: tidyverse, dplyr, tidyr, readr, inspectdf, caret, e1071, ggplot2

Visualisations: histograms, scatterplots with linear fit

Box-Cox transformation for normalising skewed data

ðŸ”‘ Key Steps

Data Cleaning & Taming â€“ fixed types, stripped $ signs & commas, converted negatives to positive, handled NAs & duplicates.

Outlier Treatment â€“ used IQR, percentile filters and visual histograms for advertising, population, sales.

Feature Engineering â€“ created:

sales_pct = (sales / population) Ã— 100

adv_exp_pp = (advertising / population)

Sampling & EDA â€“ drew random sample (n = 700) for analysis; produced summary stats & plots.

Box-Cox Transformation â€“ reduced skewness of sales_pct (Î» â‰ˆ 0.5) â†’ sales_pct_trans.

Linear Regression â€“ modelled sales_pct_trans ~ adv_exp_pp

Achieved RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.91 indicating strong linear fit.

Model Diagnostics â€“ checked linearity, homoscedasticity, normality & independence assumptions.

Prediction Scenarios â€“ estimated sales % at various advertising-spend levels (e.g. ~$3.14 pp â‰ˆ 25 % expected uptake).

ðŸ“Š Results & Insights

Positive linear relationship: higher ad-spend per person generally increases gadget sales %.

Box-Cox transformation improved normality (skewness â†“ to 0.06).

Extreme low/high ad-spend values may lie outside reliable prediction range.

Recommended focusing on moderate to high ad-spend (~ 3â€“6 $/person) to achieve higher sales.
